        "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"<br/>
        Now, we know what you may be thinking: <em>"Duh. It gets hotter..."</em><br/>
        But, if pressed, how would you prove it?<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Create a Python script to visualize a random sampling of 500 cities across
         the world and show the relationship between Temperature versus Latitude, Humidity, 
         Cloudiness, and Windspeed.Seperate the cities be Southern and Northern Hemisphere
          and run the same analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
       Create a heatmap showing humidity levels for each city. Then narrow down the parameters
       to find a few cities that meet the following parameters:<br/>
       <ul>
            <li>max temp 80 degrees</li>
            <li>min temp 70 degrees</li>
            <li>wind speed less than 10 mph</li>
            <li>zero cloudiness</li>
       </ul>
